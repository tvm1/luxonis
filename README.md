# Awesome app

## how to rock this ?
- clone the repo
- execute `docker-compose up`
- have a coffee 
- go to `127.0.0.1:8080`
- enjoy 

## what could be done better ?
- probably everything, if i had more time
- skipped the whole scrapy part, since they have nice jsons available
- should have used different base docker image to avoid Postgres authentication pain
- comments, docstrings, structuring, less chatgpt signature code, etc.

Works on my Arch laptop. Thanks for attention, have a nice day.
